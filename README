This is an experimental attempt to create a stateful web framework which builds on top of DOM manipulation. It targets the development of web applications in Java which are itself stateful and do not require high scalability. Such a framework could for example be used in intranet solutions where the model of this framework would allow an event-driven, more traditional Java programing model as for example Swing where all components are rerendered via XHR when their state changes. This is an after-work project of mine and still in the make.
